# CaraML

## About
CaraML is a Django website where you can train your own linear model without code. First, upload a labelled dataset and choose your preferred specifications. Then, we'll determine how accurate your linear model is in predicting the accuracy of your labels. Then, you can also use this model to predict on new data using unlabelled data!

## Highlights
* Users are able to choose categorical variables (columns with String data), which will automatically be one hot encoded
* Users can visualize the target variable vs all other variables before selecting the features for their model
* Results of the linear model are stored in a history tab for later reference
* Blurbs at each step help to explain the steps of the regression to those less familiar with a linear regression model!
